# The Android build of Ren-C is designed to be packaged as a webserver, so
# that it can provide a "backdoor" of native services to a browser on a phone
# which is running another interpreter as the WebAssembly version for the UI.

# !!! Currently we're only testing cross-compilation on Linux and MacOS, but
# since the NDK is offered on Windows as well we should make sure that works

# Note: These builds are particularly slow because the first interpreter was
# compiled with TCC and with asserts/debug info, and then the second interpreter
# is building using that.  We could turn off the debug info, but it's better to
# have it on so we can catch anomalies.

      # If you override one emulator option with the emulator GitHub Action,
      # you have to override them all.
      #
      # An important choice is to take off the `-no-snapshot` switch, because
      # we want to run multiple invocations of the emulator action.  We don't
      # want it to cold boot between these invocations, so letting it save
      # its state makes the startup much faster.
      #
      # We also add `-writable-system`, so that if you use adb shell to run
      # `sudo root; sudo remount` then %/system will be writable.  This isn't
      # critical at the moment since we can write to `/data/local/tmp`, which
      # is apparently the preferred place for writing test files.  But it may
      # come in handy at some point.

      # Google has deprecated the emulation of ARM Android hardware on the
      # desktop emulator application itself.  Instead, x86-based Androids
      # actually do the translation of ARM binaries...and then the emulator
      # can run x86 Android on top of the (often) x86 host processor.  But
      # that translation started in Android 11 with API Level 30.  If you go
      # back to API level 29, an ARM binary won't be handled and you will
      # get a message like:
      #
      #    /data/local/tmp/r3: not executable: 32-bit ELF file
      #
      # https://github.com/ReactiveCircus/android-emulator-runner
      #
      EMULATOR_API_LEVEL: 30

      # The host is OS X 64-bit, so that raises the question of whether it's
      # better to emulate an x86 or x86_64 device:
      #
      #        x86 boot time: 214147 ms
      #     x86_64 boot time: 201991 ms
      #
      # A little faster to go with x86_64, but not so much that it would be
      # a big deal if some bug on x86_64 emulation forced us back to x86.
      #
      # https://github.com/ReactiveCircus/android-emulator-runner
      #
      EMULATOR_ARCH: x86_64  # [x86 x86_64]

      # Since we need at least API level 30 for ARM translation, we find that
      # here is no `default` x86 or x86_64 image for android-30.  The only
      # entries in `sdkmanager --list` are these four:
      #
      #    system-images;android-30;google_apis;x86
      #    system-images;android-30;google_apis;x86_64

      #    system-images;android-30;google_apis_playstore;x86_64

  #====# TESTING STEP #=======================================================#
  #
  # Starting and stopping the emulator is extremely slow.  The first time
  # is always a "cold boot", and takes about 201 seconds to start.  If you
  # don't set the `-no-snapshot` emulator option then subsequent startups
  # can be around 152 seconds.
  #
  # Given how slow it is, we try to do as much as we can in one emulator
  # session.  The way the emulator-runner works is that it runs the commands
  # line-by-line, and any of them that return a non-zero result will stop the
  # whole step.  Output printed to standard output in the android executable
  # will be relayed back by `adb shell` so it can be read in the output log.
