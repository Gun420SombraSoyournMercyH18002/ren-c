#
# GitHub Actions Workflow for using TCC to build Ren-C with the TCC extension,
# and then use that executable to bootstrap.  A demonstration of this ability
# was first made in July 2019, video here:
#
# https://youtu.be/PT3GOe1pj9I?t=163
#
# The bootstrapping executable is not deployed to AWS for downloading, as it's
# more a stunt than being intended for use (since there's not much
# optimization in TCC, it's better to build with GCC or Clang).
#
#====# PLEASE READ THE README #===============================================#
#
# Whenever this file says "See README", that is referring to the notes in the
# %.github/workflows/README.md file.  If something appears in multiple GitHub
# Workflow files, it's best to document it there instead of repeating it:
#
# https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/blob/master/.github/workflows/README.md
#

name: TCC Build


# Controls when the action will run.  Because the bootstrap currently eats
# a lot of cycles, we could use up our GitHub Actions quota quickly if every
# build ran it.  (It's slow because the first interpreter was compiled with
# TCC and with asserts/debug info, and then the second interpreter is building
# using that.  We could turn off the debug info, but it's better to have it
# on so we can catch anomalies...hence slow is the best option here.)
#
# So right now it's set up to be only triggered manually from the Actions tab,
# and we can just remember to do it now and again.
#
# We could also limit it based on the commit message, e.g.
#
#    if: contains(github.event.head_commit.message, 'TCC')
#
# This could be done at the whole job level, or on individual steps.

  #====# BOOTSTRAP STEPS #====================================================#
  #
  # Here we want to pull of the trick of using the single produced exe to
  # download the .ZIP file from GitHub (using the network layer, HTTP, and TLS
  # cryptography all implemented in Ren-C)...and then unzip it using the
  # usermode .ZIP code, and then build it.
  #
  # To help reinforce the validity of the stunt, we remove anything that could
  # be interpreted as helping...including the TCC compiler we just used,
  # and the source code that the `git` executable had been used to cloned.
  #

    # Note: We don't uninstall `libtcc-dev` because we are choosing to build
    # the TCC extension into the executable we are building with r3-with-tcc.

    # Note: The BOOTSTRAP command downloads a ZIP file from GitHub.  The
    # format of such zip files is that they contain a single directory of
    # `$PROJECT-$BRANCH`, so it uncompresses the sources into a subdirectory
    # here of %ren-c-master/
    #
    # Then BOOTSTRAP will make a %build/ directory underneath that, where
    # the build products will be put.

    # We uninstalled TCC, which had libtcc1.a and some header overloads we
    # require.  To better understand "compiler intrinsics" and why those files
    # are necessary, see the TCC extension's README.md.
    #
    # https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/blob/master/extensions/tcc/README.md
    #
    # Ideally these would be encapped into executables that are built with the
    # TCC extension.  Right now we settle for a .zip file which is downloaded
    # as part of the BOOTSTRAP command, and put in the %tccencap/ directory.
    # Set that to the CONFIG_TCCDIR.
    #
    # Long-term, this would be handled behind-the-scenes so the user would
    # not have to see it.
    #
    # Also, in order to build user natives, one of the headers used by the
    # process needs to be `librebol.h`.  We don't use a fixed version in the
    # `tccencap` that BOOTSTRAP from the web, because we'd like an up to the
    # minute version from the build we just made.
    #
    # The long-term answer to this is for that encapping process to include
    # the librebol.h and the precise libtcc files from the build.  So a test
    # like this would effectively be using the file it just made, just like
    # we are doing here.
