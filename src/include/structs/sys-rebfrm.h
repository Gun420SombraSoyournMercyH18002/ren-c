// This declares the structure used by frames, for use in other structs.
// See %sys-frame.h for a higher-level description.
//


// !!! A REBFRM* answers that it is a node, and a cell.  This is questionable
// and should be reviewed now that many features no longer depend on it.

#define EVAL_FLAG_0_IS_TRUE FLAG_LEFT_BIT(0) // IS a node
STATIC_ASSERT(EVAL_FLAG_0_IS_TRUE == NODE_FLAG_NODE);

#define EVAL_FLAG_1_IS_FALSE FLAG_LEFT_BIT(1) // is NOT free
STATIC_ASSERT(EVAL_FLAG_1_IS_FALSE == NODE_FLAG_STALE);


//=//// EVAL_FLAG_ALLOCATED_FEED //////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// Some frame recursions re-use a feed that already existed, while others will
// allocate them.  This re-use allows recursions to keep index positions and
// fetched "gotten" values in sync.  The dynamic allocation means that feeds
// can be kept alive across contiuations--which wouldn't be possible if they
// were on the C stack.
//
// If a frame allocated a feed, then it has to be freed...which is done when
// the frame is dropped or aborted.
//
// !!! Note that this is NODE_FLAG_MANAGED.  Right now, the concept of
// "managed" vs. "unmanaged" doesn't completely apply to frames--they are all
// basically managed, but references to them in values are done through a
// level of indirection (a varlist) which will be patched up to not point
// to them if they are freed.  So this bit is used for another purpose.
//
#define EVAL_FLAG_ALLOCATED_FEED \
    FLAG_LEFT_BIT(2)

STATIC_ASSERT(EVAL_FLAG_ALLOCATED_FEED == NODE_FLAG_MANAGED);  // should be ok

//=//// EVAL_FLAG_BRANCH ///////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// If something is a branch and it is evaluating, then it cannot result in
// either a pure NULL or a void result.  So nulls must be turned into null
// isotopes and voids are turned into none (~) isotopes.
//
#define EVAL_FLAG_BRANCH \
    FLAG_LEFT_BIT(3)


//=//// EVAL_FLAG_CACHE_NO_LOOKAHEAD //////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// Without intervention, running an invisible will consume the state of the
// FEED_FLAG_NO_LOOKAHEAD.  That creates a problem for things like:
//
//     >> 1 + comment "a" comment "b" 2 * 3
//     == 7  ; you'll get 7 and not 9 if FEED_FLAG_NO_LOOKAHEAD is erased
//
// Originally invisible functions were pre-announced as purely invisible, and
// would un-set the flag while the invisible ran...then restore it to the
// previous state.  But this has changed to were it's not known until after
// a function has executed if it was invisible.
//
// The current logic is to cache the *feed* flag in this *frame* flag before
// each function runs, and then restore it in the event the execution turns
// out to be invisible.
//
// Note: This is the same flag value as FEED_FLAG_NO_LOOKAHEAD.
//
// !!! This could lead to "multiplying" the influences of the flag across
// several invisible evaluations; this should be reviewed to see if it makes
// any actual problems in practice.
//
#define EVAL_FLAG_CACHE_NO_LOOKAHEAD \
    FLAG_LEFT_BIT(4)

STATIC_ASSERT(EVAL_FLAG_CACHE_NO_LOOKAHEAD == FEED_FLAG_NO_LOOKAHEAD);


//=//// EVAL_FLAG_NO_EVALUATIONS //////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// It might seem strange to have an evaluator mode in which no evaluations are
// performed.  However, this simplifies the implementation of operators such
// as ANY and ALL, which wish to run in an "inert" mode:
//
//     >> any [1 + 2]
//     == 3
//
//     >> any @[1 + 2]
//     == 1
//
// Inert operations wind up costing a bit more because they're pushing a frame
// when it seems "they don't need to"; but pushing a frame also locks the
// series in question against enumeration.
//
#define EVAL_FLAG_NO_EVALUATIONS \
    FLAG_LEFT_BIT(5)


//=//// EVAL_FLAG_TRAMPOLINE_KEEPALIVE ////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// This flag asks the trampoline function to not call Drop_Frame() when it
// sees that the frame's `executor` has reached the `nullptr` state.  Instead
// it stays on the frame stack, and control is passed to the previous frame's
// executor (which will then be receiving its frame pointer parameter that
// will not be the current top of stack).
//
// It's a feature used by routines which want to make several successive
// requests on a frame (REDUCE, ANY, CASE, etc.) without tearing down the
// frame and putting it back together again.
//
#define EVAL_FLAG_TRAMPOLINE_KEEPALIVE \
    FLAG_LEFT_BIT(6)


// !!! Historically frames have identified as being "cells" even though they
// are not, in order to use that flag as a distinction when in bindings
// from the non-cell choices like contexts and paramlists.  This may not be
// the best way to flag frames; alternatives are in consideration.
//
#define EVAL_FLAG_7_IS_TRUE FLAG_LEFT_BIT(7)
STATIC_ASSERT(EVAL_FLAG_7_IS_TRUE == NODE_FLAG_CELL);


//=//// FLAGS 8-15 ARE USED FOR THE "STATE" byte ///////////////////////////=//
//
// One byte's worth is used to encode a "frame state" that can be used by
// natives or dispatchers, e.g. to encode which step they are on.

//=//// EVAL_FLAG_RUNNING_ENFIX ///////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// Due to the unusual influences of partial refinement specialization, a frame
// may wind up with its enfix parameter as being something like the last cell
// in the argument list...when it has to then go back and fill earlier args
// as normal.  There's no good place to hold the memory that one is doing an
// enfix fulfillment besides a bit on the frame itself.
//
// It is also used to indicate to a ST_EVALUATOR_REEVALUATING frame whether
// to run an ACTION! cell as enfix or not.  The reason this may be overridden
// on what's in the action can be seen in the REBNATIVE(shove) code.
//
#define EVAL_FLAG_RUNNING_ENFIX \
    FLAG_LEFT_BIT(16)


//=//// EVAL_FLAG_DIDNT_LEFT_QUOTE_PATH ///////////////////////////////////=//
//
// There is a contention between operators that want to quote their left hand
// side and ones that want to quote their right hand side.  The left hand side
// wins in order for things like `help default` to work.  But deciding on
// whether the left hand side should win or not if it's a PATH! is a tricky
// case, as one must evaluate the path to know if it winds up producing a
// right quoting action or not.
//
// So paths win automatically unless a special (rare) override is used.  But
// if that path doesn't end up being a right quoting operator, it's less
// confusing to give an error message informing the user to use -> vs. just
// make it appear there was no left hand side.
//
#define EVAL_FLAG_DIDNT_LEFT_QUOTE_PATH \
    FLAG_LEFT_BIT(17)


//=//// EVAL_FLAG_DELEGATE_CONTROL ////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// A dispatcher may want to run a "continuation" but not be called back.
// This is referred to as delegation.
//
#define EVAL_FLAG_DELEGATE_CONTROL \
    FLAG_LEFT_BIT(18)


//=//// EVAL_FLAG_ABRUPT_FAILURE ///////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// !!! This is a current guess for how to handle the case of re-entering an
// executor when it fail()s abruptly.  We don't want to steal a STATE byte
// for this in case the status of that state byte is important for cleanup.
//
#define EVAL_FLAG_ABRUPT_FAILURE \
    FLAG_LEFT_BIT(19)


//=//// EVAL_FLAG_BLAME_PARENT ////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// Marks an error to hint that a frame is internal, and that reporting an
// error on it probably won't give a good report.
//
#define EVAL_FLAG_BLAME_PARENT \
    FLAG_LEFT_BIT(20)


//=//// EVAL_FLAG_ROOT_FRAME //////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// This frame is the root of a trampoline stack, and hence it cannot be jumped
// past by something like a YIELD, return, or other throw.  This would mean
// crossing C stack levels that the interpreter does not control (e.g. some
// code that called into Rebol as a library.)
//
#define EVAL_FLAG_ROOT_FRAME \
    FLAG_LEFT_BIT(21)


//=//// EVAL_FLAG_MAYBE_STALE /////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// This is a flag that is passed to the evaluation to indicate that it should
// not assert if it finds a value in the ouput cell already.  But also that
// it should not clear the stale flag at the end of the evaluation--because
// the caller may wish to know whether a new value was written or not.  See
// ALL for an optimized use of this property (to avoid needing to write to
// a scratch cell in order to reverse the effects of a void evaluation step).
//
#define EVAL_FLAG_MAYBE_STALE \
    FLAG_LEFT_BIT(22)


//=//// EVAL_FLAG_ERROR_ON_DEFERRED_ENFIX /////////////////////////////////=//
//
// There are advanced features that "abuse" the evaluator, e.g. by making it
// create a specialization exemplar by example from a stream of code.  These
// cases are designed to operate in isolation, and are incompatible with the
// idea of enfix operations that stay pending in the evaluation queue, e.g.
//
//     match+ parse "aab" [some "a"] else [print "what should this do?"]
//
// MATCH+ is variadic, and in one step asks to make a frame from the right
// hand side.  But it's 99% likely intent of this was to attach the ELSE to
// the MATCH and not the PARSE.  That looks inconsistent, since the user
// imagines it's the evaluator running PARSE as a parameter to MATCH (vs.
// MATCH becoming the evaluator and running it).
//
// It would be technically possible to allow ELSE to bind to the MATCH in
// this case.  It might even be technically possible to give MATCH back a
// frame for a CHAIN of actions that starts with PARSE but includes the ELSE
// (which sounds interesting but crazy, considering that's not what people
// would want here, but maybe sometimes they would).
//
// The best answer for right now is just to raise an error.
//
#define EVAL_FLAG_ERROR_ON_DEFERRED_ENFIX \
    FLAG_LEFT_BIT(23)


//=//// EVAL_FLAG_NOTIFY_ON_ABRUPT_FAILURE ////////////////////////////////=//
//
// Most frames don't want to be told about the errors that they themselves...
// and if they have cleanup to do, they could do that cleanup before calling
// the fail().  However, some code calls nested C stacks which use fail() and
// it's hard to hook all the cases.  So this flag can be used to tell the
// trampoline to give a callback even if the frame itself caused the problem.
//
// To help avoid misunderstandings, trying to read the STATE byte when in the
// abrupt failure case causes an assert() in the C++ build.
//
#define EVAL_FLAG_NOTIFY_ON_ABRUPT_FAILURE \
    FLAG_LEFT_BIT(24)


//=//// EVAL_FLAG_FULFILLING_ARG //////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// Deferred lookback operations need to know when they are dealing with an
// argument fulfillment for a function, e.g. `summation 1 2 3 |> 100` should
// be `(summation 1 2 3) |> 100` and not `summation 1 2 (3 |> 100)`.  This
// also means that `add 1 <| 2` will act as an error.
//
#define EVAL_FLAG_FULFILLING_ARG \
    FLAG_LEFT_BIT(25)

STATIC_ASSERT(DETAILS_FLAG_IS_BARRIER == EVAL_FLAG_FULFILLING_ARG);


//=//// EVAL_FLAG_NO_RESIDUE //////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// Sometimes a single step evaluation is done in which it would be considered
// an error if all of the arguments are not used.  This requests an error if
// the frame does not reach the end.
//
// !!! Interactions with ELIDE won't currently work with this, so evaluation
// would have to take this into account to greedily run ELIDEs if the flag
// is set.  However, it's only used in variadic apply at the moment with
// calls from the system that do not use ELIDE.  These calls may someday
// turn into rebValue(), in which case the mechanism would need rethinking.
//
// !!! A userspace tool for doing this was once conceived as `||`, which
// was variadic and would only allow one evaluation step after it, after
// which it would need to reach either an END or another `||`.
//
#define EVAL_FLAG_NO_RESIDUE \
    FLAG_LEFT_BIT(26)


//=//// EVAL_FLAG_META_RESULT ////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// When this is applied, the Trampoline is asked to return an evaluator result
// in its ^META form.  Doing so saves on needing separate callback entry
// points for things like meta-vs-non-meta arguments, and is a useful
// general facility.
//
#define EVAL_FLAG_META_RESULT \
    FLAG_LEFT_BIT(27)


//=//// EVAL_FLAG_28 //////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// Note: This bit is the same as CELL_FLAG_NOTE, which may be something that
// could be exploited for some optimization.
//

//
// * EVAL_FLAG_XXX: Evaluator_Executor()
//
// None defined yet.
//
// * EVAL_FLAG_DISPATCHER_CATCHES: Action_Executor()
//
// Every Executor() gets called with the chance to cleanup in the THROWING
// state.  But in the specific case of the Action_Executor(), it uses this
// flag to keep track of whether the dispatcher it is calling (a kind of
// "sub-executor") wants to be told about the thrown state.  This would be
// something like a WHILE loop wanting to catch a BREAK.
//

//=//// EVAL_FLAG_EXECUTOR_30 /////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// This is a flag that can be used specific to the executor that is running.
//
// * EVAL_FLAG_TO_END: Evaluator_Executor()
//
// !!! This is a revival of an old idea that a frame flag would hold the state
// of whether to do to the end or not.  The reason that idea was scrapped was
// because if the Eval() routine was hooked (e.g. by a stepwise debugger)
// then the hook would be unable to see successive calls to Eval() if it
// didn't return and make another call.  That no longer applies, since it
// always has to return in stackless to the Trampoline, so TO_END is really
// just a convenience with no real different effect in evaluator returns.
//
// * EVAL_FLAG_FULFILL_ONLY: Action_Executor()
//
// In some scenarios, the desire is to fill up the frame but not actually run
// an action.  At one point this was done with a special "dummy" action to
// dodge having to check the flag on every dispatch.  But in the scheme of
// things, checking the flag is negligible...and it's better to do it with
// a flag so that one does not lose the paramlist information one was working
// with (overwriting with a dummy action on FRM_PHASE() led to an inconsistent
// case that had to be accounted for, since the dummy's arguments did not
// line up with the frame being filled).

//
// Another flag that can be picked specific to the running executor.
//
// * EVAL_FLAG_INERT_OPTIMIZATION: Evaluator_Executor()
//
// If ST_EVALUATOR_LOOKING_AHEAD is being used due to an inert optimization,
// this flag is set, so that the quoting machinery can realize the lookback
// quote is not actually too late.
//
// *  EVAL_FLAG_TYPECHECK_ONLY: Action_Executor()
//
// This is used by <blank> to indicate that once the frame is fulfilled, the
// only thing that should be done is typechecking...don't run the action.

// All frames must include EVAL_MASK_DEFAULT in their flags.  This is not
