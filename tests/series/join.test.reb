; JOIN has become the unified replacement for REJOIN, AJOIN, etc.
;
; It does not reduce block arguments that are being joined onto the base value.
; You need to use either a GET-BLOCK! or run reduce.
;
; An additional feature is that it accepts a datatype as the first argument,
; to say what the JOIN result should be typed as.
