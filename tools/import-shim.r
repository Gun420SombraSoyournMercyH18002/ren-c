    Title: {Fake IMPORT/EXPORT for Bootstrap, enable use of COMMA! syntax}
    File: %import-shim.r
    Description: {
        If a module imports %common.r, that should also imply the import of
        definitions from %bootstrap-shim.r.  This is not something obvious how
        to do in the R3-Alpha module system.

        Ren-C wants something like `Baseline: %bootstrap-shim.r` in the module
        header to indicate inheriting from places other than lib.  The feature
        is not ready at time of writing, so it is faked by having %common.r
        export the export list from %bootstrap-shim.r.  But it is on the radar.

        This shim redefines IMPORT for the bootstrap executable to be a synonym
        for DO, when the `Type: module` annotation is removed.  That just
        puts everything into the user context, which is ugly but made to work
        in order to use the old executable to build.  It also avoids importing
        things more than once, so it achieves a similar semantic to modules.

        So long as it is doing that, it also strips out the commas.  This
        doesn't let them act as expression barriers but can help readability.
        Additionally it turns lone quotes into the word `null`.
    }
    Notes: {
        * DO no longer changes the working directory to system.script.path,
          so to include this it should say this magic incantation:

            if not find words of import 'product [
                do load append copy system/script/path %import-shim.r
            ]

          This helps standardize the following rules between the new and the
          old bootstrap executable:

            https://github.com/metaeducation/rebol-issues/issues/2374

          A couple of points...  :-(

          LOAD is used so that the DO does not have the legacy behavior of
          changing to the directory of %import-shim.r, because it's just doing
          a BLOCK!.  This also keeps it from resetting the directory when the
          DO is over, so we can CHANGE-DIR in this script to compensate for
          the changing into the script directory...making it appear that the
          command line processing never switched the dir in the first place.

          APPEND is used instead of JOIN because the bootstrap executable
          semantically considers JOIN to be mutating.  The decision on this
          was that JOIN would be non-mutating but also non-reducing.  But the
          bootstrap-shim.r can't be imported until after the import-shim.r, so
          using APPEND is the clearest alternative.)

          There seems to be flakiness on recursive DO in the bootstrap EXE.
          So having multi-inclusion handled inside this script isn't an option,
          because READs and other things start panic'ing randomly.  It seems
          avoiding recursion solves the issue.
